    A/B Test
        Definition
            An A/B test involves testing two versions of a web page, an A version (the control) and a B version (the variation), with live traffic and measuring the effect each version has on your metric of interest (for example: conversion rate, click rate).
        In an A/B test, how can you check if assignment to the various buckets was truly random?
            One way to check is to look at metrics that should not be changed by the experiments and test that the distributions are similar in the two buckets (example: demographic data, number of visitors, browser version, time of assignment). The best way to test is to run A/A experiments. An A/A test is simply a test where both pages/ad copy/creatives/etc. are exactly the same. You split your traffic randomly and showing both groups the same page. A/A will help you check your split testing tool and help you understand the expected variation in your metrics.

            What is the complexity of 'in' in Python?
        Answer
            list - Average: O(n)
            set/dict - Average: O(1), Worst: O(n)
    You have 100 .csv files in a folder, and they all have the same header. The files are named data1, …, data100. We want all these .csv files stored in one data frame. How would you do that in R?
        1. store file names is a character vector
        2. use an apply statement to read the files into a data.frame (result: list of data frames)
        3. concatenate all these data frame into a single big one
        # something like this
        files.names = paste('data', 1:100, '.csv', sep='')
        tables = lapply(files.names, function(file){read.csv(file, header=T)}
        do.call(rbind, tables) ## rbindlist should have a better performance
    Suppose you are working at a casino, and the casino manager asks you if a single die is fair to use. How would you go about confirming that?
        Step 1: Throw the die a few of times, say N and record the results. (what N should be?)
            Say you get X = (X_1, … X_6) where X_i is the number of times you see i.
        Step 2: Do a formal hypothesis testing to check whether or not you should reject the null hypothesis of the die being fair. In this case we can do a Chi^2 test for multinomial data.
            Null Hypothesis: Die is fair.
            Under the null hypothesis X = (X_1, … X_6) is a multinomial (N, p=(⅙, …,⅙ )) distribution.
                Compute
                    T = \sum_k (X_i N/6)^2 / N/6
            Under H0 T is distributed Chi^2 with k1 degrees of freedom.
                p-value can be computed as P(Chi^2_k1 > T)
            If the p-value is below a threshold that I fixed in advance (say 0.01), I would reject that the coin is fair.
    Suppose you are working on a model and you get a high error:
        get more training examples ==> fixes high variance
        try smaller set of features ==> fixes high variance
        try getting additional features ==> fixes high bias
        try getting polynomial features ==> fixes high bias
        try increasing lambda (penalty term) ==> fixes high bias
        try decreasing lambda (penalty term) ==> fixes high variance
    Suppose you are working on a model and you get a high error:
        if you have high variance
            get more training examples
            try smaller set of features
            try decreasing lambda (penalty term)
        if you have high bias
            try getting additional features
            try getting polynomial features
            try increasing lambda (penalty term)
    What do you do with missing data?

        remove rows

    What do you do when you have two classes and one is underrepresented?
    What would you do with a multi-class/label problem?
