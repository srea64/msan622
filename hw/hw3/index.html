<h2>Summary</h2>

<!-- A short (1 to 3 paragraphs, 3 to 5 sentences per paragraph) discussion about the functionality you implemented. Focus on providing motivation behind some of your design decisions (e.g. why you choose to remove/add an element, how you decided on colors, etc.). This discussion could influence how your visualization is evaluated in peer reviews. You do not need to re-list everything you implemented! -->


For the first plot I added the ability to zoom and drag the plot around so that you could split.  I was happy to find code that updates the axes as you zoom in and move around.  For the second plot I implemented the brush example we looked at in class.  I used the same dataset for both to be able to focus on implementing the visualizations.
<br>I was once again pleasantly surprised by how professional D3's visualizations came out, even if it isn't as straightforward as I would like.


<h4>Preprocessing</h4>

In order to get the data into as nice a format as possible before working with it, I made sure to add a column of dates by month.  This column is in the original dataset as rownames, so when you write to a csv it isn't saved.  Adding it as a separate column was rather simple.
<br>

<br># create vector of months to add to dataframe
<br>month <- seq(as.Date("1969-01-01"), by = "month", length.out = nrow(Seatbelts))
<br>
<br># add to dataframe
<br>df['month'] <- month
<br>
<br># create dataset
<br>df2 <- df[,c('month','DriversKilled')]

<h4>Interaction</h4>
Plot 1 has drag and zoom features, so make sure to click and drag and use your wheel mouse (or pad) to zoom in and out of it.
<br>
Plot 2 has brushing, so you can click and drag on the bottom chart which will filter the selection in the upper chart.  From there you can drag the box and it will update what you are viewing in the top chart.

<h2>I implemented the following:</h2>

<h3>C Level - Basic Functionality</h3>

<ul>
    <li>Line Plot (Plot 1)</li>
    <li>Area Plot (Plot 2)</li>
</ul>

<h3>B Level - Moderate Functionality</h3>

See Plot 1 for:

<ul>
    <li>Zooming (e.g. zoom in when scroll mouse wheel)</li>
    <li>Panning (e.g. click and drag for rectangular visualizations)</li>
</ul>

<h3>A Level - Advanced Functionality</h3>

See Plot 2 for:

<ul>
    <li>Brushing</li>
</ul>
