<h4> Basic Functionality </h4>

I implemented the following:

<ol>
    <li>You will need to choose a world projection.
    <li>You will need to be able to change how the projection scale is set based on the projection used. 
    <li>You will need to update anywhere d.lon and d.lat are used, since the CSV file uses d.longitude and d.latitude instead.
    <li>You will need to comment out the code drawing of the state objects, since you will be working with countries instead.
    <li>You will need to change how the text at the bottom is formed based on the data provided in the earthquake feed.
</ol>

<h4>Interaction</h4>

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
Highlighting any of the circles representing an earthquake will give the location where the earthquake occurred as well as the earthquake's magnitude.
